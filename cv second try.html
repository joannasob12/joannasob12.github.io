 <p><a href="mailto:joanna_sobczak@outlook.com">joanna_sobczak@outlook.com</a></p> 
 <p1>I am currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science with a specialisation in Social Analytics following my Bachelors in Criminology and Sociology with Quantitative Methods. Over my year as a master's student, I will have become highly proficient in multiple coding languages, including Python and R. Overall, my academic journey has equipped me with a unique blend of skills in data visualisation, social research, statistics and quantitative analysis, allowing me to approach data- driven challenges from a multidisciplinary perspective. This is further enhanced by my own work experience which has allowed for me to understand how to apply these skills in a work environment where I may contribute to projects by applying quantitative analysis and/or data science to real-world problems which, during my time at National Centre for Social Research, has contributed to making a positive impact on society.</p1>

<h2> Projects</h2>
<li><strong> Atmospheric Gas Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction </strong> (Distinction) </li>
<p1> Explored environmental data from the Mauna Loa Observatory to detect trends in greenhouse gas emissions.</p1>
    <details>
        <summary style="font-size: smaller"><em>Details</em></summary>
        <p1>- Handled 18% missing data using multiple imputation (PMM) and assessed MCAR vs MAR/MNAR.<br>
            - Conducted EDA with boxplots, correlation matrices, and distribution analysis for gases including CO₂, CH₄, and CFC-11.<br>
            - Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality (80% variance explained by PC1 & PC2).<br>
            - Compared unsupervised clustering methods: K-means, K-Medoids (PAM), Hierarchical, and Gaussian Mixture Models (Mclust). <br>
            - Used R libraries: tidyverse, mice, factoextra, cluster, mclust, and corrplot.
        </p1>
    </details>
<li><strong> Wine Quality Classification Using Machine Learning  </strong> (Distinction) </li>
<p1> Built predictive models to classify wine as high or low quality using physicochemical features.</p1>
<details>
    <summary style="font-size: smaller"><em>Details</em></summary>
    <p1>- Cleaned and merged red and white wine datasets with class imbalance correction. <br>
        - Applied Lasso Regression for feature selection and Random Forest for non-linear modeling.<br>
        - Conducted hyperparameter tuning (λ in Lasso; ntree, mtry in RF), and evaluated models with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE.<br>
        - Found Lasso outperformed RF on the combined dataset (97% accuracy), while RF was better for red/white separately.<br>
        - Tools: Python (scikit-learn, statsmodels, seaborn); academic supervision confirmed methodology validity.
